# An example control file - this will find all organic structures 
# with up to 100 atoms, Z' = 1, only 1 component that isnt disordered and
# has a low R-Factor

# only include organic structures as output
organic : 1
# number of atoms to allow through
atom count : 0 100
# Ensure Z-prime is one
zprime range : 0.99 1.01
# Ensure only one component in the structure
component range : 0 1
# Dont include disordered structures
disordered : 0
# Specify an R-factor range
rfactor range : 0.1 5
