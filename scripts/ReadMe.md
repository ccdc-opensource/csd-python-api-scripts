This folder contains scripts submitted by users or CCDC scientists for anyone to use freely.

## Concat Mol2

- Concatenates mol2 files present in working directory to a single `.mol2` file.

## Create CASTEP Input

- Creates input files (`.cell` and `.param`) files for a given compound through Mercury.

## Create GAUSSIAN Input

- Create GAUSSIAN input file (`.gjf`) for a given CSD refcode or `.mol2` file.

## Find Binding Conformation

- Generates idealized conformers for ligands and evaluates their RMSD to the conformation in the PDB.

## GOLD-multi

- Use the CSD Docking API and the multiprocessing module to parallelize GOLD docking.

## Hydrogen bond propensity

- Writes a `.docx report` of a hydrogen bond propensity calculation for any given `.mol2`/refcode.

## MOF subset 2017 Chem Mater publication

- Two scripts that were supplementary information in the publication "Development of a Cambridge Structural Database Subset:
 A Collection of Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks for Past, Present, and Future" DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b00441>

## Multi-component hydrogen bond propensity

- Performs a multi-component HBP calculation for a given library of co-formers.

## Packing similarity dendrogram

- Construct a dendrogram for an input set of structures based on packing-similarity analysis.

## Particle Rugosity

- Calculates the simulated BFDH particle rugosity weighted by facet area.

## Surface Charge

- Calculates the surface charge for a given structure and surface terminations. Runs both from CMD and Mercury.

## Refcodes With Properties

- A script for generating refcode lists with specific properties from an easy-to-read control file.

## Tips
