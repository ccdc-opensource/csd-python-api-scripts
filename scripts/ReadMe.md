### Hydrogen bond propensity
- Writes a `.docx report` of a hydrogen bond propensity calculation for any given `.mol2`/refcode.

### Multi-component hydrogen bond propensity 
- Performs a multi-component HBP calculation for a given library of co-formers. 

### Packing similarity dendrogram
- Construct a dendrogram for an input set of structures based on packing-similarity analysis.

### GOLD-multi
- Use the CSD Docking API and the multiprocessing module to parallelize GOLD docking.

### Find Binding Conformation
- Generates idealized conformers for ligands and evaluates their RMSD to the conformation in the PDB.

### Concat Mol2
- Concatenates mol2 files present in working directory to a single `.mol2` file. 

### Create CASTEP Input
- Creates input files (`.cell` and `.param`) files for a given compound through Mercury.

### Create GAUSSIAN Input
- Create GAUSSIAN input file (`.gjf`) for a given CSD refcode or `.mol2` file.

### Particle Rugosity
- Calculates the simulated BFDH particle rugosity weighted by facet area.
